                </a>
            <p> <strong> The Quran </strong>Is the most important text in islam and it should be studied <strong> alongside or after aqeedah </strong>. One must read, recite, memorize and implement the quran in our day to day life so that we may attain the mercy of Allah swt and be of the righteous in sha Allah. Verily, the prophet said, "The best among you is the one who learns the Quran, and teaches it." This section will have the text of the quran, tafsir, the history, preservation, compilation, and transmission of the Quran.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section" id="aqeedah">
            <h2>Aqeedah / Theology</h2>
            <a href="aqeedah.html">
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Istanbul%2C_Hagia_Sophia%2C_Allah.jpg/640px-Istanbul%2C_Hagia_Sophia%2C_Allah.jpg" alt="Allah">
            </a>
            <p><strong>What is Aqeedah?</strong> Aqeedah is our beliefs as muslims, mainly the 6 pillars of iman. This should be the first thing you learn. It is the foundation of our religion, and one cannot advance into other fields withous having the proper aqeedah. If one's aqeedah is improper, he may fall into shirk and bi'dah without realizing, and all of your good deeds will not benefit you when you are upon shirk. So one must study and know Tawhid, to have it, and one must study and know shirk to avoid it. If your aqeedah is improper, all of your actions and studying will be of no use to you. As Allah says *in meaning* <strong> "if you associate others ˹with Allah˺, your deeds will certainly be void and you will truly be one of the losers."</strong> </p>

            </a>
            <p>The manners of the student of knowledge covers the ettiquete of a talib 'ilm. one cannot be a talib 'ilm without having the proper mannerisms of a true muslim. If you are commiting alot of sins, this will make it very hard for you to retain knowledge! and if you do not have the proper ettituqe, it will be hard for people to want to teach you and for people to listen to you while teaching them. Ibn qayyim writes on the effects of sins, <strong>"The Prevention of Knowledge: Knowledge is a light which Allah throws into the heart and disobedience extinguishes this light. Imam Shaafi'ee said:
                I complained to Wakee' about the weakness of my memory. So he ordered me to abandon disobedience and informed me that the knowledge is light and that the light of Allah is not given to the disobedient. One should study this section alongside aqeedah and before the Quran.

            </a>
            <p>The seerah is the biography of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). However, this section will also include the biographies of other important Islamic figures such as the Salaf as-Salih. Knowing the life of the prophet muhammad pbuh is integral to ur day to day life, since we seek to emulate him. One must also see how he taught others and carried himself so we can learn how to advise eachother properly. As the Quran states, *in meaning* <strong>"There has certaintly been for you in the messenger of Allah an excellent pattern for anyne whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and who remembers Allah often" 33:21 </strong>This section shold be studied after aqeedah, manners, and alongside or after the Quran./p>

            <a></a>
            <p>The hadiths are the sayings of the prophet muhammad pbuh. This is the last section you should be studying, as it can be very complex. However, it is still very important to know the hadeeths, since it explains the Quran and is also a source of guidance for us. One can read hadiths and it will benefit you, however, without the guidacne of a scholar you will not know <strong>how</strong> to read the hadiths. This section will only have basic hadith texts and will include youtube playlists alongside with the pdfs of an ustadh explaining the book.</strong></p>
